This repository contains the data and analysis code for the study: Song, Z., & van Schaik, C. P. (2025). Slowly but Surely: Larger Brains Improve Immature Survival in Primates. American Journal of Primatology, 87(9), e70072.

**Overview**
Code and data for Larger Brains Improve Immature Survival in Primates. Using long-term demographic records from 18 primate species, we test whether brain size enhances immature survival. Analyses show strong positive effects, especially in the first year, supporting parental investment as a key mechanism.
